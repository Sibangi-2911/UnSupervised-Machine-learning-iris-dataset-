I had to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

This is a Unsupervised Machine Learning model as we are provided with the input. Only grouping of data by finding the features of data and patterns of data is done in Unsupervised learning.

1.import all packages

2.data reading

3.data cleaning

4.input creation by dropping the Species column

5.model training-K means clustering

6.prediction

7.find the centroid values

8.create a new column prediction in the dataset

9.Plot the graph
